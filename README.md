**Getting Started With Using SerpApi**

You can use our APIs in multiple languages, but for the purposes of this blog post, I've used Python.

To begin scraping data, first, create a free account on serpapi.com. You'll receive 250 free search credits each month to explore the API.

Get your SerpApi API Key from this page: https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key. 

Set your API key in an environment variable, instead of directly pasting it in the code. For this tutorial, I have saved the API key in an environment variable named "SERPAPI_API_KEY" in my .env file. [Optional but Recommended]

Next, on your local computer, you need to install a couple libraries:

`pip install google-search-results Pillow pytersseract`

We'll also need to install Tesseract OCR itself. The installation process will depend on your operating system. For MacOS, you can use `brew install tesseract`.

**Run The Code**
